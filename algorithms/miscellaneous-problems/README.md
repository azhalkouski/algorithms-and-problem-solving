In the context of algorithms and problem-solving, __miscellaneous problems__ generally
refer to a collection of problems that do not fit unto a specific category or domain.
These problems can span a wide variety of topics and often serve as practice to
test your general problem-solving skills, logcal thingkin, and adaptability.

__Characteristics of Miscellaneous Problems__
1. Broad Scope:
- They can involve various concepts like arrays, strings, graphs, dynamic programming,
ets., often combining multiple areas in a single problem.
2. No Specific Theme:
- Unlike focused categories (e.g., "Sorting Algorithms" or "Graph Problems"), misc.
problems may not fall under any predefined domanin or pattern.
3. Diverse Difficulty Levels:
- These problems can range from simple to highly complex, and they may test conceptual
clarity or creative thinking.
