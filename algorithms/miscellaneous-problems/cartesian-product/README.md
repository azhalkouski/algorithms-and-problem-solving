__Problem__
Given two finit non-empty sets, find their Cartesian Product.

In mathematics, specifically set theory, the Cartesian product of two sets A and B,
denoted AxB, is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where a is in A and b is in B.

const A = [1,2];
const B = [3,4];

AxB = [[1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4]];
